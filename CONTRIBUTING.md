Hello there! Thank you for the cheking out neuropredict, and for your interest in contributing. 

As you may notice, this is a realtively new project with exciting roadmap, atleast in scope and long term goals. The core functions (learning, cross-validation and visualization) have been implemented already. Hence you could contribute in the following areas:
 - identifying any bugs by focusing on the areas of neuropredict that you have expertise in
 - sharpening or improving the focus of the repo in general
 - propose interesting, popular and exciting use cases that neuropredict could support to further multiply its value
 - improving code base in terms of modularity, building an API-like interface for programmatic access, ideas for GUI development
 - installing and using it to ensure it works as advertised (and fix it otherwise)
 
 TO be improved and completed.
