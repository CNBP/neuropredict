Usage
-----------------------

The command line interface for neuropredict is strongly recommended (given its focus on batch processing multiple comparisons). If the installation was successful, options could be obtained by typing one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    neuropredict
    neuropredict -h


Those options are also shown below:

.. argparse::
   :module: neuropredict.run_workflow
   :func: get_parser
   :prog: neuropredict
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:
