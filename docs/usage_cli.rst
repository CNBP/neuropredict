Usage and examples
-----------------------

The command line interface for neuropredict is strongly recommended (given its focus on batch processing multiple comparisons). If the installation was successful, options could be obtained by typing one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    neuropredict
    neuropredict -h


Those options are also shown below (may not always show up due to problems with software for auto generation of docs). Check the bottom of this page for examples.

If you don't see the options below, click here :doc:`usage_manual`

.. argparse::
   :module: neuropredict.run_workflow
   :func: get_parser
   :prog: neuropredict
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:

A rough example of usage can be:

.. code-block:: bash

    neuropredict -m meta_data.csv -f /work/project/features_dir


**Example for meta-data**

  For example, if you have a dataset with the following three classes: 5 controls, 6 disease_one and 9 other_disease, all you would need to do is produce a meta data file as shown below (specifying a class label for each subject):

.. parsed-literal::

    3071,controls
    3069,controls
    3064,controls
    3063,controls
    3057,controls
    5004,disease_one
    5074,disease_one
    5077,disease_one
    5001,disease_one
    5002,disease_one
    5003,disease_one
    5000,other_disease
    5006,other_disease
    5013,other_disease
    5014,other_disease
    5016,other_disease
    5018,other_disease
    5019,other_disease
    5021,other_disease
    5022,other_disease


and `neuropredict` will produce the figures (and numbers in a CSV files) as shown here:

.. image:: composite_flyer.001.png

The higher resolution PDFs are included in the `docs <docs/results_vis>`_ folder.

The typical output on the command line would like something like:

.. parsed-literal::

    neuropredict -y *.MLDataset.pkl -m meta_FourClasses.csv -o ./predictions -t 0.75 -n 250

    Requested features for analysis:
    get_pyradigm from chebyshev.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from chebyshev_neg.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from chi_square.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from correlate_1.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from correlate.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from cosine_1.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from cosine_2.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from cosine_alt.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from cosine.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from euclidean.MLDataset.pkl
    get_pyradigm from fidelity_based.MLDataset.pkl
    Different classes in the training set are stratified to match the smallest class!
